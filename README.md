1. `chemStructures` - Visualizing organic molecules using the Open Source `MolView` package. Note: I added a PDF that Eileen produced in LaTeX in 2019. This TeX file (functional_groups.tex) will no longer compile because of changes in the LaTeX `chemfig` package. We never could find the problem.

The LaTeX failure was at Line 75 with this error message:

```
! Incomplete \iffalse; all text was ignored after line 75.
<inserted text> 
                \fi 
<*> functional_groups.tex^^M
